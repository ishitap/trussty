Hi! Welcome to this `d3.js` / `numeric.js` truss solver app. :3 Progress is on `solver.html`.

Usage:
------
- `n`: node mode (create nodes by clicking and move nodes around by dragging)
- `t`: trusss mode (create trusses by dragging between nodes)
- `f`: force mode (create forces by dragging a force from a node)
- `g`: fixed mode (set a node as fixed joint by clicking on it)
- `r`: rolling mode (set a node as folling joint by clicking on it)
- `SHIFT+click`: remove anything! (be careful, removing nodes removes all attached trusses

To print your work in JSON, you can use util.printString() in the console.
